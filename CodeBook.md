# Code Book

The source data is described in [the UCI site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  The resulting tidy data set is organized as follows:
* The data is sorted by subject, then by activity
* the other columns are the mean and std values from the source data
* the data values consiste of mean values by subject and activity 

The details of the process I used to transform and tidy the data can be found in [README.md](README.md)
